## Summary

Remotely sensed data is earth observation data collected from satellites. The practice can vary in several ways; the type of sensor used, the waves the sensor picks up on, and in the various resolutions the collected data can come in. Remotely sensed data is often more complex than other kinds of spatial data, usually (but not always) contained in a raster form, which can be challenging to use, clean, and interpret. Obtaining it often requires less reliance on authorities than other spatial data, and there are many free resources available for its procurement and processing.

Though both passive and active sensors absorb electromagnetic radiation waves bounced from Earth, they differ in the origin point of these waves. The waves picked up by active sensors typically originate from the sun, though night-time use may look at human-emitted light as well. This works similarly to the human eye. Active sensors, on the other hand, emit wavelengths at Earth and record how they bounce back, closer to how a bat emits sonar to locate prey. Examples of this in remote sensing include SAR, synthetic aperture radar, as well as LiDAR and radar.

EMR waves are not always cleanly transmitted from their source to Earth to the satellite. Energy can be scattered by atmospheric particles, particularly clouds, making remote sensing difficult. Where this happens, switching from the short wavelengths of the visible light spectrum to the longer ones implemented by active sensors such as SAR can help the waves to pass through scattering particles and deliver cleaner data.

There are four kinds of resolution involved in remote sensing; spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal. Spatial resolution indicates the amount of space that each pixel represents; spectral resolution the values for each wavelength across the visible and non visible spectrum that are represented in a feature, and temporal the time of revisit. I am not entirely sure what radiometric represents; the slides said "differences in energy" which sounds like something to do with EMR waves that I don't quite understand.

## Applications

I found two interesting applications of SAR used in archaeology to compare for this week. I used to work in archaeology and the idea of having technology to identify sites from space is very cool to me - certainly beats standing around in rainy construction sites looking in holes, which was mostly my experience!

In the first paper, "SAR Imaging of Archaeological sites on Intertidal Flats in the German Wadden Sea" (2019), the authors used SAR to identify land uses of historic settlements flooded hundreds of years ago. Because the flood plain is difficult to access and excavate, remote sensing became a vital tool. 19 images with a high resolution of \<1m2 allowed for the detection of very fine structures.

This was particularly effective because of the water left on the surface in the smooth areas between archaeological disturbance - it is smooth and thus black, making ridges left by ditches and old foundations stand out. Initially reading this paper it made a lot of sense to me why they would use SAR, as they are looking for textural disturbance; but this aerial image they provided of the site did make me wonder why they would not use passive sensors and the spectral band, as it looks like that provides plenty of data too.

Where SAR really shines is in temporal comparative study, as it was used in the paper "'Looting marks' in space-borne SAR imagery: Measuring rates of archaeological looting in Apamea (Syria) with TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight" (2016). In their research, the authors looked at a series of 5 SAR images of their site over the course of a year in order to find holes dug in the site by looters hoping to steal artefacts. Their textural analysis essentially subtracted each image layer from the previous one in order to identify changes that had occurred. Using SAR instead of colour band imagery in this case makes sense, as it can identify surface level alterations that could be missed due to inconsistent light conditions, or differing colour contrast between images.

## Reflections

Working with SNAP this week was quite challenging as I found the program crashed on me very frequently, but it was still interesting to look at the different layers. It helped me understand the concept of colour bands given this week. I'm excited to try out different programs to visualise satellite imagery later in the course, particularly non-colourband data such as heat, or radar based data like SAR.

I think learning about active sensors was more interesting to me this week than passive sensors. Most of my ideas of remote sensing were really just about colour band data on the visible spectrum, so the idea of seeing textures is very cool to me. The non-visible spectral signatures of passive sensors, like infrared, are also very interesting. Can ultraviolet light be captured with passive sensors? I read a great book recently called "An Immense World" by Ed Yong that discusses different animal sense organs that we do not possess and how it changes their experience of the world, and a major topic was ultraviolet light and how there are many cues from it that we cannot pick up on. For example, "targets" on flowers that show bees where to find nectar. A project utilising remotely sensed ultraviolet to identify or classify plant species areas could be cool!

Electromagnetic waves are really interesting to me but I find the idea difficult to conceptualise. The comparison to ocean waves made it a little clearer to me, but what is an electromagnetic wave moving in the vacuum of spaces? Just energy? I wonder if it is possible to visualise the presence of electromagnetic wave sources on Earth with remote sensing if that is the case - sounds like it could be a cool project. Also - good to know about Planet giving educational licences for high resolution imagery - could come in useful for my dissertation later.
