The practice can vary in several ways; the type of sensor used, the waves the sensor picks up on, and in the various resolutions the collected data can come in. Remotely sensed data is often more complex than other kinds of spatial data, usually (but not always) contained in a raster form, which can be challenging to use, clean, and interpret. Obtaining it often requires less reliance on authorities than other spatial data, and there are many free resources available for its procurement and processing.\n\nThough both passive and active sensors absorb electromagnetic radiation waves bounced from Earth, they differ in the origin point of these waves. The waves picked up by active sensors typically originate from the sun, though night-time use may look at human-emitted light as well. This works similarly to the human eye.

Energy can be scattered by atmospheric particles, particularly clouds, making remote sensing difficult. Where this happens, switching from the short wavelengths of the visible light spectrum to the longer ones implemented by active sensors such as SAR can help the waves to pass through scattering particles and deliver cleaner data.\n\nThere are four kinds of resolution involved in remote sensing; spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal. Spatial resolution indicates the amount of space that each pixel represents; spectral resolution the values for each wavelength across the visible and non visible spectrum that are represented in a feature, and temporal the time of revisit.
