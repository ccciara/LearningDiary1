It makes sense that researchers are not very interested in advertising their potential failures, but it does make it challenging to learn anything from them! The spatial dependence I've learned about before I think has mostly been about how models trained on one region, say a city, may struggle to reach the same high classification accuracy when tested on another city. This version of spatial dependence made sense to me, but it is interesting to think about how this disparity between success scores may also be due to spatial autocorrelation within the model's training and testing data sets leading to over-inflated success scores. The recommended method of dividing areas into testing and training regions, rather than testing and training points makes sense for me in avoiding this phenomenon. This is great to know and keep in mind when I work on my assessments this term as several of them involve classification tasks.\n\n## References\n\nCánovas-García, F., Alonso-Sarría, F., Gomariz-Castillo, F. and Oñate-Valdivieso, F.
