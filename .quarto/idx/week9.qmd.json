They used multivariate linear regression with 4m resolution IKONOS imagery for land cover classification and ASTER satellite data for LST. Their regression analysis indicated high levels of statistical significance between land classification type and LST measurement, and the models then implemented to simulate the proposed greening of parking lots. Though this is a good basic model, from my research on LST prediction it seems unlikely that this would be extremely accurate, as LST depends on many more variables than land classification alone. I have to wonder whether spatial autocorrelation might have played a role in their multivariate linear regression and wonder how they split their data into training and testing sets.\n\n![LST predictions from \"Evaluating the potential for urban heat-island mitigation by greening parking lots\" (2010)](images/9.1.jpg)\n\nThe second paper, \"Time series analysis of land surface temperature and drivers of urban heat island effect based on remotely sensed data to develop a prediction model\" by Khalil et al (2021) performed a similar analysis, but took more factors into consideration and constructed a CNN to predict LST rather than multivariate linear regression, allowing them to capture more complex relationships within the data. Instead of looking at land cover classifications, they used an enhanced vegetation index (EVI) along with road density and elevation. Their CNN displayed an accuracy level of 87% when asked to predict temperatures over several months. However, I also have to wonder if this might be affected by spatial autocorrelation. They state that their data was split into 70:30 for training and validation, but not if they split it into points (could induce spatial autocorrelation) or larger areas (less of a risk). Though they did take many factors into account, there does seem to still be major discrepancies between their predicted LST and the actual LST.\n\n![Difference between predicted and recorded LST from \"Time series analysis of land surface temperature and drivers of urban heat island effect based on remotely sensed data to develop a prediction model\" (2021)](images/9.2.jpeg)\n\n## Reflections\n\nAgain, temperature is complex! I suspect that any model would have to be trained specifically on the area that it will be used to make predictions on, as there are so many local variables that are difficult to account for. However, this also induces risks of spatial autocorrelation that brings accuracy rates into question. Reading papers about the use of ENVI-met modelling incorporating so many factors such as individual building height and meteorological data such as humidity and wind speed and direction makes it clear that it is not possible to fully predict heat from satellite imagery alone. However, the ability to capture LST from satellites has enabled the ability to measure the impacts of elements recorded through non-satellite means upon ground temperature. The new use of neural networks and deep learning is very exciting for the incorporation of more variables and complex data into analysis and prediction. I can see this becoming very important for future implementation of urban greening measures, which I think has the potential to help urban inhabitants in many ways - not just in terms of physical health but also socially, environmentally, and mentally.\n\n## References\n\nWilson, B.
